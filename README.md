# Merge & Match

**Merge & Match** is a web-based puzzle game that challenges players to clear a grid by selecting and merging shapes strategically. The game offers four difficulty levels: **Easy**, **Medium**, **Hard**, and **Impossible**.

## 📜 Game Rules

- **Objective**: Clear the grid in as few moves as possible.
- **How to Play**:
  1. Select two cells.  
  2. If the shapes in the cells match, both cells are cleared.  
  3. If they don’t match, the second cell updates to a "mix" (XOR) of both patterns.  
  4. Follow the specific rules based on the selected difficulty level.

## 🎮 Difficulty Levels
1. **Easy**: Select any two cells.
2. **Medium**: Select two cells in the same row, column, or diagonal.
